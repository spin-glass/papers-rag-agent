Despite\nunderpinning remarkably capable large language models, transformers are unable\nto model many context-free language tasks. In an attempt to address this\nlimitation in the modeling power of transformer-based language models, we\npropose augmenting them with a differentiable, stack-based attention mechanism.\nOur stack-based attention mechanism can be incorporated into any\ntransformer-based language model and adds a level of interpretability to the\nmodel.

    "summary": "The Transformer architecture has become widely adopted due to its\ndemonstrated success, attributed to the attention mechanism at its core.\nDespite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated\nwith two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to\naddress both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To\nhandle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism,\nreferred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its\ndual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike\nconventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores\nwhile preserving a fixed total sum. We provide theoretical evidence that the\nproposed dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) effectively mitigates both the\nrank-collapse and gradient vanishing issues which are difficult to resolve\nsimultaneously with the conventional attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority\nof daGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\nneural machine translation.",

    "summary": "Unneeded elements in the attention's context degrade performance. We\nintroduce Selective Attention, a simple parameter-free change to the standard\nattention mechanism which reduces attention to unneeded elements. Selective\nattention consistently improves language modeling and downstream task\nperformance in a variety of model sizes and context lengths. For example,\ntransformers trained with the language modeling objective on C4 with selective\nattention perform language modeling equivalently to standard transformers with\n~2X more heads and parameters in their attention modules. Selective attention\nalso allows decreasing the size of the attention's context buffer, leading to\nmeaningful reductions in the memory and compute requirements during inference.\nFor example, transformers trained on C4 with context sizes of 512, 1,024, and\n2,048 need 16X, 25X, and 47X less memory for their attention module,\nrespectively, when equipped with selective attention, as those without\nselective attention, with the same validation perplexity.",

For multi-head\nattention in Transformer ASR, it is not easy to model monotonic alignments in\ndifferent heads. To overcome these two limits, we integrate sparse attention\nand monotonic attention into Transformer-based ASR.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) for public use require continuous pre-training\nto remain up-to-date with the latest data. The models also need to be\nfine-tuned with specific instructions to maintain their ability to follow\ninstructions accurately. Typically, LLMs are released in two versions: the Base\nLLM, pre-trained on diverse data, and the instruction-refined LLM, additionally\ntrained with specific instructions for better instruction following. The\nquestion arises as to which model should undergo continuous pre-training to\nmaintain its instruction-following abilities while also staying current with\nthe latest data. In this study, we delve into the intricate relationship\nbetween continuous pre-training and instruction fine-tuning of the LLMs and\ninvestigate the impact of continuous pre-training on the instruction following\nabilities of both the base and its instruction finetuned model. Further, the\ninstruction fine-tuning process is computationally intense and requires a\nsubstantial number of hand-annotated examples for the model to learn\neffectively. This study aims to find the most compute-efficient strategy to\ngain up-to-date knowledge and instruction-following capabilities without\nrequiring any instruction data and fine-tuning. We empirically prove our\nfindings on the LLaMa 3, 3.1 and Qwen 2, 2.5 family of base and instruction\nmodels, providing a comprehensive exploration of our hypotheses across varying\nsizes of pre-training data corpus and different LLMs settings.",

    "summary": "The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language\nmodels has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning\nand reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and\ndistillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove\neffective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to\ndistillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation\nreveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length\nCollapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF\ntraining, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score\ndrops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally\ncompromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage\nweighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and\ndistillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this\nintermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational\nknowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and\ndetailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves\nSequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables\ncontinuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our\nanalysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs\nbetween training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work\nprovides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,\nenabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency\nwith RLHF alignment.",

    "summary": "The dominant paradigm for RLHF is online and on-policy RL: synchronously\ngenerating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward\nmodel, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant,\nthis paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL\nliterature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables\nasynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training on old\nsamples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However,\nasynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but off-policy\nRLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a\nworse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how\nmuch off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up\nlearning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test,\nonline DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness\nincreases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute\noptimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance\ncost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous\nRLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an\ninstruction-following task ~40% faster than a synchronous run while matching\nfinal performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to\ndemonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k ~70% faster while\nmatching synchronous accuracy.",

To fill this\ngap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e.\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key\nproperties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD\ngeneralisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which\nthese models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's\nability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases.\nWe perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and\ninstruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM\nuse cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs,\nparticularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger.\nHowever, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a\nvariety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods\nbetween generalisation and diversity.

    "summary": "Linear RNNs with gating recently demonstrated competitive performance\ncompared to Transformers in language modeling. Although their linear compute\nscaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over\nTransformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom\nkernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels\n(Dao, 2024). Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs,\nFlash Linear Attention (FLA) (Yang & Zhang, 2024) shows that linear RNN kernels\nare faster than Flash Attention, by parallelizing over chunks of the input\nsequence. However, since the chunk size of FLA is limited, many intermediate\nstates must be materialized in GPU memory. This leads to low arithmetic\nintensity and causes high memory consumption and IO cost, especially for\nlong-context pre-training. In this work, we present Tiled Flash Linear\nAttention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, that enables\narbitrary large chunk sizes and high arithmetic intensity by introducing an\nadditional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, we apply\nTFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM (Beck et al., 2024). Second, we\npropose an mLSTM variant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for\neven faster kernel runtimes at equal language modeling performance.

This task demands the language\nmodel's ability to comprehend lengthy contextual inputs and to capture the\ninteraction between query and document tokens. We find that (1) Mamba models\nachieve competitive performance compared to transformer-based models with the\nsame training recipe; (2) but also have a lower training throughput in\ncomparison to efficient transformer implementations such as flash attention. We\nhope this study can serve as a starting point to explore Mamba models in other\nclassical IR tasks. Our code implementation and trained checkpoints are made\npublic to facilitate reproducibility\n(https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/RankMamba).",

    "summary": "The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a\nvariety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we\nobserve that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they\neither require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing\nopen-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in\nsubjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of\nbenchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate\nmetric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of\ngenerative language models can differ significantly based on the language being\nused. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual\nquestion answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs.\nOur benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an\nimage and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance.\nThe grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the\njudge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By\ndefining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small\nopen-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In\naddition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we\nalso experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading\ncriteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

To improve efficiency, we construct a subset that\nyields results comparable to full benchmark evaluations.

    "summary": "The evaluation of large language models is an essential task in the field of\nlanguage understanding and generation. As language models continue to advance,\nthe need for effective benchmarks to assess their performance has become\nimperative. In the context of Traditional Chinese, there is a scarcity of\ncomprehensive and diverse benchmarks to evaluate the capabilities of language\nmodels, despite the existence of certain benchmarks such as DRCD, TTQA, CMDQA,\nand FGC dataset. To address this gap, we propose a novel set of benchmarks that\nleverage existing English datasets and are tailored to evaluate language models\nin Traditional Chinese. These benchmarks encompass a wide range of tasks,\nincluding contextual question-answering, summarization, classification, and\ntable understanding. The proposed benchmarks offer a comprehensive evaluation\nframework, enabling the assessment of language models' capabilities across\ndifferent tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5,\nTaiwan-LLaMa-v1.0, and Model 7-C, our proprietary model, on these benchmarks.\nThe evaluation results highlight that our model, Model 7-C, achieves\nperformance comparable to GPT-3.5 with respect to a part of the evaluated\ncapabilities. In an effort to advance the evaluation of language models in\nTraditional Chinese and stimulate further research in this field, we have\nopen-sourced our benchmark and opened the model for trial.",

While the\nNepali Language Understanding Evaluation (Nep-gLUE) benchmark provides a\nfoundation for evaluating models, it remains limited in scope, covering four\ntasks. This restricts their utility for comprehensive assessments of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) models. To address this limitation, we introduce\ntwelve new datasets, creating a new benchmark, the Nepali /Language\nUnderstanding Evaluation (NLUE) benchmark for evaluating the performance of\nmodels across a diverse set of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks. The\nadded tasks include Single-Sentence Classification, Similarity and Paraphrase\nTasks, Natural Language Inference (NLI), and General Masked Evaluation Task\n(GMET). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing top models\nstruggle with the added complexity of these tasks. We also find that the best\nmultilingual model outperforms the best monolingual models across most tasks,\nhighlighting the need for more robust solutions tailored to the Nepali\nlanguage.

We propose MultiPL-E, a system for\ntranslating unit test-driven code generation benchmarks to new languages. We\ncreate the first massively multilingual code generation benchmark by using\nMultiPL-E to translate two popular Python code generation benchmarks to 18\nadditional programming languages.\n  We use MultiPL-E to extend the HumanEval benchmark and MBPP benchmark to 18\nlanguages that encompass a range of programming paradigms and popularity. Using\nthese new parallel benchmarks, we evaluate the multi-language performance of\nthree state-of-the-art code generation models: Codex, CodeGen, and InCoder. We\nfind that Codex matches or even exceeds its performance on Python for several\nother languages. The range of programming languages represented in MultiPL-E\nallow us to explore the impact of language frequency and language features on\nmodel performance. Finally, the MultiPL-E approach of compiling code generation\nbenchmarks to new programming languages is both scalable and extensible, making\nit straightforward to evaluate new models, benchmarks, and languages.",

To gauge the significance of agent architecture, we\nimplement a target-driven planning (TDP) module as an adjunct to the existing\nagent. Our evaluative findings highlight that the STSS benchmark is challenging\nfor state-of-the-art language agents. Furthermore, it effectively discriminates\nbetween distinct language agents, suggesting its usefulness as a benchmark for\nevaluating both language models and agent architectures.",

    "summary": "We assess how multilingual language models maintain a shared multilingual\nrepresentation space while still encoding language-sensitive information in\neach language. Using XLM-R as a case study, we show that languages occupy\nsimilar linear subspaces after mean-centering, evaluated based on causal\neffects on language modeling performance and direct comparisons between\nsubspaces for 88 languages. The subspace means differ along language-sensitive\naxes that are relatively stable throughout middle layers, and these axes encode\ninformation such as token vocabularies. Shifting representations by language\nmeans is sufficient to induce token predictions in different languages.\nHowever, we also identify stable language-neutral axes that encode information\nsuch as token positions and part-of-speech. We visualize representations\nprojected onto language-sensitive and language-neutral axes, identifying\nlanguage family and part-of-speech clusters, along with spirals, toruses, and\ncurves representing token position information. These results demonstrate that\nmultilingual language models encode information along orthogonal\nlanguage-sensitive and language-neutral axes, allowing the models to extract a\nvariety of features for downstream tasks and cross-lingual transfer learning.",

    "summary": "Understanding representation transfer in multilingual neural machine\ntranslation (MNMT) can reveal the reason for the zero-shot translation\ndeficiency. In this work, we systematically analyze the representational issue\nof MNMT models. We first introduce the identity pair, translating a sentence to\nitself, to address the lack of the base measure in multilingual investigations,\nas the identity pair can reflect the representation of a language within the\nmodel. Then, we demonstrate that the encoder transfers the source language to\nthe representational subspace of the target language instead of the\nlanguage-agnostic state. Thus, the zero-shot translation deficiency arises\nbecause the representation of a translation is entangled with other languages\nand not transferred to the target language effectively. Based on our findings,\nwe propose two methods: 1) low-rank language-specific embedding at the encoder,\nand 2) language-specific contrastive learning of the representation at the\ndecoder. The experimental results on Europarl-15, TED-19, and OPUS-100 datasets\nshow that our methods substantially enhance the performance of zero-shot\ntranslations without sacrifices in supervised directions by improving language\ntransfer capacity, thereby providing practical evidence to support our\nconclusions.

    "summary": "Recent multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) often avoid using\nlanguage embeddings -- learnable vectors assigned to individual languages.\nHowever, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode\nall language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To\naddress this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual\nPretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script\nembeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these\nembeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final\nrepresentations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP\nto the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering\nmore than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the\nbaseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks.\nExtensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture\nlanguage- and script-specific nuances, which benefits more language-neutral\nrepresentations, proven by improved pairwise cosine similarity. In our case\nstudy, we also show that language and script embeddings can be used to select\nbetter source languages for crosslingual transfer.

This representation\nis then exploited by the attention function, which learns dependencies between\ntokens and is key to the success of Transformers. However, the iterative\napplication of attention across layers induces complex dynamics that remain to\nbe fully understood. To analyze these dynamics, we identify each input sequence\nwith a probability measure and model its evolution as a Vlasov equation called\nTransformer PDE, whose velocity field is non-linear in the probability measure.\nOur first set of contributions focuses on compactly supported initial data. We\nshow the Transformer PDE is well-posed and is the mean-field limit of an\ninteracting particle system, thus generalizing and extending previous analysis\nto several variants of self-attention: multi-head attention, L2 attention,\nSinkhorn attention, Sigmoid attention, and masked attention--leveraging a\nconditional Wasserstein framework. In a second set of contributions, we are the\nfirst to study non-compactly supported initial conditions, by focusing on\nGaussian initial data. Again for different types of attention, we show that the\nTransformer PDE preserves the space of Gaussian measures, which allows us to\nanalyze the Gaussian case theoretically and numerically to identify typical\nbehaviors.

    "summary": "Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the\nfield of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,\nthey quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities\nwith various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the\nattention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales\nfrom potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to\nincorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based\non ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar\nproblems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in\nthis paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a\nmathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then\nmathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct\nfrom the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived\nformulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard\nSoftmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the\nhierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an\nefficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived\nattention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the\nproposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train\ntransformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it\ncan also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained\ntransformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in\nzero-shot manner.",
