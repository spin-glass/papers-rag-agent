# Markdownlint Rules

When editing or generating Markdown files, follow [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) rules.

## Key Rules

- Use ATX headings (`#`, `##`, â€¦), no Setext (`===`, `---`)  (MD003, MD018)
- Heading levels should only increment by one level at a time (MD001)
- No trailing spaces at line end (MD009)
- Hard tabs are not allowed; use spaces (MD010)
- Maximum line length: 80 characters (MD013)
- Code blocks fenced with backticks, specify language (MD040, MD046)
- Blank line before headings, lists, and code blocks (MD022, MD031)
- Lists should be consistent in style (MD004, MD005)
- No consecutive blank lines (MD012)
