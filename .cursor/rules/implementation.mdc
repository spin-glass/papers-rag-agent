# Implementation Rule

## Principle

When assigned a task, **always create a Linear issue before starting any implementation**.
Pull Requests (PRs) must reference the corresponding Linear issue.

## Workflow

- Follow the sequence **Linear Issue → Branch → PR**.
- PR titles must include the Linear issue key (e.g., `RAG-123`).
- PR descriptions must include the Linear issue URL or reference (e.g., `Closes RAG-123`).
- Do **not** open a PR without an existing Linear issue.

## Examples

- ✅ Correct: `RAG-123: Implement retry logic`
- ❌ Incorrect: `Add retry logic` (missing issue key)
