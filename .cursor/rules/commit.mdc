# Commit Message Rules

**IMPORTANT: Always write commit messages in English, never in Japanese or any other language.**

Follow the [**Conventional Commits v1.0.0** specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Format

```<type>[optional scope]: <description>```

## Types

feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert

## Rules

- Scope is optional but recommended (e.g., retriever, ui, docs)
- Description should be written in **present tense imperative**
  - ✅ "add retriever module"
  - ❌ "added retriever module" / "adds retriever module"
- Start with lowercase letter
- Do not end with period
- Subject line should be 72 characters or less

## Examples

- feat(retriever): add FAISS-based retriever with reranker
- fix(ui): correct citation highlighting bug
- docs: update README with LangGraph flow spec
- refactor(agent): simplify Summarizer input/output schema
- chore: update dependencies
- revert: revert commit abc123
